        The World Health Organization recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic
        physical activity throughout the week for adults aged 18-64. However, what happens if we
        adjust that number to 110 minutes every day? While it might seem like a high number to hit,
        dedicating 110 minutes daily to sporting activities may offer unparalleled benefits to
        physical health, mental well-being, and overall quality of life.
